# IotClient

This is a [project submission][iotcup project] for the [IoT Cup][iotcup] and covers data analysis and data visualization of mobile sensor data. 

## Getting Started

This project is seperated into [IotServer][iotserver] and [IotClient][iotclient]. The server is listening on the local network for UDP packages which are send by the [IotClient][iotclient] android application. The IotClient is sending sensor information (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetic field) which is then processed by the server and stored in a database. The server is serving the visualization of the sensor data at http://localhost:3000, where the data is accessed with [jQuery] via a provided minimal [REST API][restapi]. The visualization is done with the HTML [Canvas][canvas] element and [D3.js][d3].
